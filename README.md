## üß† Project Overview

### About the Competition  
The **WiDS Datathon 2025** is a machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle in collaboration with the **Ann S. Bowers Women‚Äôs Brain Health Initiative (WBHI)**, **Cornell University**, and **UC Santa Barbara**. The datasets and support are provided by the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)**, the signature scientific initiative of the **Child Mind Institute**, and the **Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC)** project.

This datathon is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, designed to give women and nonbinary students hands-on experience in machine learning while contributing to a meaningful real-world problem in neuroscience and mental health.

### Challenge Objective  
Participants are tasked with building a machine learning model to **predict an individual‚Äôs ADHD diagnosis and sex** using both **functional brain imaging data** (connectome matrices from fMRI scans) and **socio-demographic, emotional, and parenting-related metadata**.

This is a **multitask classification** problem with two binary targets:
- `ADHD_Outcome`: 0 = Other/None, 1 = ADHD
- `Sex_F`: 0 = Male, 1 = Female

### Real-World Significance  
Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD in children and adolescents can lead to better outcomes through timely interventions. This competition explores whether functional brain imaging, combined with socio-emotional and parenting data, can be used to support such diagnoses. By advancing these models, we contribute to the growing field of computational psychiatry and help pave the way for more personalized and data-driven approaches to mental healthcare.

## üîç Data Exploration

###Dataset Description
This project uses neuroimaging and behavioral data from the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Kaggle competition to predict ADHD diagnosis. The dataset contains information from 1,213 subjects organized into three main components:

**1. Target Variables:**
- Binary indicators for ADHD diagnosis and biological sex
- Stored in `TRAINING_SOLUTIONS_new.csv`

**2. Functional Brain Connectome Data:**
- High-dimensional representation of brain connectivity (19,900 features per subject)
- Features represent correlation strengths between pairs of brain regions
- Column names follow a pattern like "0throw_1thcolumn", "0throw_2thcolumn", etc., indicating connections between specific brain regions
- Stored in `TRAIN_FUNCTIONAL_CONNECTOME_MATRICES_new.csv`

**3. Categorical Metadata (`TRAIN_CATEGORICAL_METADATA_new.csv`):**
- Demographic information (enrollment year, study site)
- Child characteristics (race, ethnicity)
- MRI scan location
- Parent education and occupation levels

**4. Quantitative Metadata (`TRAIN_QUANTITATIVE_METADATA_new.csv`):**
- Behavioral assessments (SDQ, APQ)
- Handedness scores (EHQ)
- Vision test results
- Age at MRI scan

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing Approach
Our exploration and preprocessing pipeline consisted of the following key steps:

**1. Initial Data Assessment:**
- Loaded and examined the structure of all four datasets
- Analyzed class distribution (found approximately equal representation of ADHD/non-ADHD participants)
- Checked for missing values and correlations between variables
- Identified relationships between datasets using participant IDs

**2. Functional Connectome Analysis:**
- Visualized connectivity matrices to understand brain region relationships
- Analyzed the distribution of connectivity values across participants
- Applied dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) to visualize patterns in high-dimensional data
- Examined differences in connectivity patterns between ADHD and non-ADHD subjects

**3. Behavioral and Socio-demographic Analysis:**
- Investigated relationships between ADHD status and categorical variables
- Analyzed differences in behavioral metrics (SDQ, APQ) between groups
- Identified the most important features for ADHD prediction
- Explored correlations between behavioral measures and ADHD diagnosis

**4. Data Preprocessing:**
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation strategies
- Applied feature scaling and normalization
- Used Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for feature extraction from connectome data
- Prepared data for machine learning by splitting into training and testing sets
