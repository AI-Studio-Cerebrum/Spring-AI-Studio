## üß† Project Overview

### About the Competition  
The **WiDS Datathon 2025** is a machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle in collaboration with the **Ann S. Bowers Women‚Äôs Brain Health Initiative (WBHI)**, **Cornell University**, and **UC Santa Barbara**. The datasets and support are provided by the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)**, the signature scientific initiative of the **Child Mind Institute**, and the **Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC)** project.

This datathon is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, designed to give women and nonbinary students hands-on experience in machine learning while contributing to a meaningful real-world problem in neuroscience and mental health.

### Challenge Objective  
Participants are tasked with building a machine learning model to **predict an individual‚Äôs ADHD diagnosis and sex** using both **functional brain imaging data** (connectome matrices from fMRI scans) and **socio-demographic, emotional, and parenting-related metadata**.

This is a **multitask classification** problem with two binary targets:
- `ADHD_Outcome`: 0 = Other/None, 1 = ADHD
- `Sex_F`: 0 = Male, 1 = Female

### Real-World Significance  
Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD in children and adolescents can lead to better outcomes through timely interventions. This competition explores whether functional brain imaging, combined with socio-emotional and parenting data, can be used to support such diagnoses. By advancing these models, we contribute to the growing field of computational psychiatry and help pave the way for more personalized and data-driven approaches to mental healthcare.
